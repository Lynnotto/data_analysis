**A Plasmodium falciparum RING Finger E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Modifies the Roles of PfMDR1 and PfCRT in Parasite Drug Responses** (2023). This study investigates the role of PfRFUL, a RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase, in antimalarial drug resistance. Knockdown of PfRFUL rendered parasites more sensitive to mefloquine, piperaquine, amodiaquine, and dihydroartemisinin, and decreased protein levels of PfMDR1 while altering post-translational modifications of PfCRT, demonstrating that ubiquitination directly regulates key drug transporter proteins in the parasite.

**Unusually Divergent Ubiquitin Genes and Proteins in Plasmodium Species** (2023). This study reveals that ubiquitin — one of the most conserved proteins across eukaryotes — has undergone unusually rapid divergence in multiple Plasmodium lineages. The ubiquitin encoded by RPL40 and RPS27a fusion genes evolved independently in distinct Plasmodium subgenera, and polyubiquitin genes acquired codon insertions previously thought to be exclusive to other organisms, suggesting lineage-specific evolutionary pressures on the ubiquitin system in malaria parasites.

**Lys48 Ubiquitination During the Intraerythrocytic Cycle of the Rodent Malaria Parasite, Plasmodium chabaudi** (2017). This study characterises Lys48-linked polyubiquitination — the canonical signal for proteasomal degradation — across ring, trophozoite, and schizont stages of Plasmodium chabaudi. Ubiquitinated proteins peak at the schizont stage and include proteins typically abundant during the trophozoite stage, suggesting that Lys48 polyubiquitination plays a key role in coordinating protein abundance and cell-cycle progression throughout the intraerythrocytic developmental cycle.

**A Plasmodium falciparum Ubiquitin-Specific Protease (PfUSP) Is Essential for Parasite Survival and Its Disruption Enhances Artemisinin Efficacy** (2023). This study characterises PfUSP, a deubiquitinating enzyme in P. falciparum, and shows it is essential for parasite growth and proteostasis. Knockdown of PfUSP significantly increased parasite sensitivity to dihydroartemisinin without affecting chloroquine sensitivity, indicating that PfUSP helps the parasite cope with artemisinin-induced stress and may represent a target to overcome artemisinin resistance.

**Plasmodium falciparum Contains Functional SCF and CRL4 Ubiquitin E3 Ligases, and CRL4 Is Critical for Cell Division and Membrane Integrity** (2024). This study demonstrates that P. falciparum possesses functional Cullin-RING ubiquitin E3 ligase complexes — PfSCF (Cullin-1-based) and PfCRL4 (Cullin-2-based). Depletion of PfCullin-2 severely impaired asexual and sexual erythrocytic development, disrupted protein translation, lipid biosynthesis, and membrane integrity, establishing CRL4 as an essential regulator of parasite cell division and a potential antimalarial drug target.
