**Dysregulated expression of the tumor suppressor p14ARF in cancer provides an effective target for TCR-T cell therapeutics.** Schmitt TM, Furiya K, Black C, Vazquez A, Sharma J, Hailemariam M, Paushter DH, Trieu L, Lam J, Lee B, Rakhra K, Whalen KA, Mehta NK, Sauer K, Baeuerle PA, Michaelson JS, Greenberg PD, Chapuis AG. *Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer*, February 2026. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41638872/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41638872/) DOI: [10.1136/jitc-2025-013520](https://doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2025-013520). The CDKN2A locus produces two tumour suppressors, p16INK4A and p14ARF, which paradoxically become overexpressed in many cancers when their downstream negative regulators are lost. This study identifies a unique, well-presented p14ARF epitope detectable in cancer biopsies but not normal tissues, and engineers high-avidity ARF-specific TCR-T cells from healthy donors. These TCRs mediated potent tumour killing in vitro and in vivo with no detectable on-target toxicity, establishing ARF's dysregulated expression as a viable and safe immunotherapeutic target.

**Paired tumor-normal sequencing provides insights into the CDKN2A-associated tumor spectrum.** Breen KE, Mehta N, Ravichandran V, Mehine M, Gao C, Fiala E, Mukherjee S, Gao M, Arora K, Kemel Y, Roth S, Arnold AG, Kennedy J, Sheehan M, Murphy F, Ptashkin R, Lin A, Walsh M, Ceyhan-Birsoy O, Tap WD, Rolston V, Murciano-Goroff YR, Latham A, Stadler ZK, Offit K, Mandelker D. *NPJ Precision Oncology*, November 2025. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41258420/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41258420/) DOI: [10.1038/s41698-025-01155-6](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41698-025-01155-6). Among 71,868 patients, 69 carried germline CDKN2A pathogenic variants: 87% affected p16INK4A, 7.2% affected p14ARF specifically, and 5.8% affected both isoforms. Biallelic inactivation of CDKN2A was observed in 70.2% of assessed tumours, including non-classic cancer types for p16INK4A variants and peripheral nervous system tumours for p14ARF variants. The findings expand the known CDKN2A-associated tumour spectrum beyond melanoma and pancreatic cancer and have direct implications for oncogenetic surveillance protocols.

**Elevated Type I Interferon Signaling Defines the Proliferative Advantage of ARF and p53 Mutant Tumor Cells.** Mabry A, Kuzmicki CE, O'Brien A, Maggi LB Jr, Weber JD. *Molecular and Cellular Biology*, 2025. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40351125/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40351125/) DOI: [10.1080/10985549.2025.2497817](https://doi.org/10.1080/10985549.2025.2497817). This study demonstrates that loss of both ARF and p53 tumour suppressors drives aggressive tumour cell proliferation through aberrant activation of type I interferon signalling, specifically requiring JAK1-mediated phosphorylation of STAT1 at Y701. Treatment with selective JAK1 inhibitors suppresses both interferon-stimulated gene expression and cell proliferation in ARF/p53-null tumour models. A subset of human tumours bearing this molecular signature was identified, suggesting JAK1-targeted therapy as a potential strategy for cancers lacking functional ARF and p53.

**Abnormal nuclear and nucleolar immunoreactivity of p16INK4a represents a frameshift alteration in CDKN2A.** Mitsui A, Kashima J, Ryo E, Nakamura Y, Ueno T, Mano H, Yatabe Y, Mori T. *Virchows Archiv*, December 2025. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41339993/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41339993/) DOI: [10.1007/s00428-025-04365-2](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00428-025-04365-2). Unusual strong nuclear and nucleolar p16INK4a immunostaining patterns can be mistaken for HPV-associated cancer, but this study reveals these patterns instead reflect frameshift mutations within the CDKN2A locus. Because p16INK4a and p14ARF are encoded by overlapping reading frames on chromosome 9p21, frameshift mutations produce chimeric proteins combining sequences from both isoforms. Recognising this distinctive staining pattern is critical for preventing misdiagnosis and avoiding inappropriate HPV-directed treatment decisions.

**Phosphorylation of CBX8 by PKD1 suppresses PRC1 activity and promotes cell senescence.** Fang Z, Liu D, Su Y, Hao F, Qin R, Li G, Chen J. *Oncogene*, February 2026. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41398073/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41398073/) DOI: [10.1038/s41388-025-03657-w](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41388-025-03657-w). This study identifies PKD1 kinase as a regulator of Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) through direct phosphorylation of CBX8, promoting ubiquitin-mediated degradation and disrupting PRC1 integrity. Loss of PRC1 activity leads to derepression of p16INK4A (encoded by CDKN2A) and induction of cellular senescence. The work places PKD1-mediated CBX8 phosphorylation as an upstream epigenetic mechanism controlling the CDKN2A/p16INK4A axis and senescence entry.

**Transformation of primary murine peritoneal mast cells by constitutive KIT activation is accompanied by loss of Cdkn2a/Arf expression.** Capellmann S, Sonntag R, Schüler H, et al. *Frontiers in Immunology*, 2023. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37063827/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37063827/) — also at [https://europepmc.org/article/MED/37063827](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/37063827). DOI: [10.3389/fimmu.2023.1154416](https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1154416). A spontaneously transformed murine mast cell line (PMC-306) displayed accelerated cell cycle progression coincident with dramatically reduced Cdkn2a and Arf expression. Sustained SCF-mediated KIT activation in primary bone marrow-derived mast cells was sufficient to recapitulate the reduction in Cdkn2a/Arf expression, implicating constitutive KIT signalling as a driver of CDKN2A/ARF suppression during mast cell transformation. The new PMC-306 line is proposed as a tool for studying mast cell leukaemia and ARF-dependent tumour suppression.

**The Yin and Yang-Like Clinical Implications of the CDKN2A/ARF/CDKN2B Gene Cluster in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.** González-Gil C, Ribera J, Ribera JM, Genescà E. *Genes*, January 2021. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33435487/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33435487/) — also at [https://europepmc.org/article/MED/33435487](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/33435487). DOI: [10.3390/genes12010079](https://doi.org/10.3390/genes12010079). This comprehensive review examines the 9p21.3 chromosomal locus encompassing CDKN2A (p16INK4A and p14ARF) and CDKN2B as one of the most frequently deleted regions in ALL. The authors survey deletion frequencies and prognostic implications across B-cell and T-cell ALL subtypes, highlighting the paradoxical context-dependent outcomes where deletions can be associated with either worse or better prognosis. Therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring or exploiting aberrant CDKN2A/ARF/CDKN2B function in leukaemia are also discussed.

**Frequency and clinical impact of CDKN2A/ARF/CDKN2B gene deletions as assessed by in-depth genetic analyses in adult T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.** Genescà E, Lazarenkov A, Morgades M, et al. *Journal of Hematology and Oncology*, 2018. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30041662/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30041662/) — also at [https://europepmc.org/article/MED/30041662](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/30041662). DOI: [10.1186/s13045-018-0639-8](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13045-018-0639-8). In a cohort of 64 adult T-ALL patients, CDKN2A/ARF/CDKN2B deletions were found in 55% of cases with homozygous deletions predominating, and these alterations correlated with cortical T-cell immunophenotype and favourable early treatment response. Integration of copy-number status with minimal residual disease (MRD) data identified a T-ALL subset with excellent overall survival that may not require stem cell transplantation. The study provides a detailed map of CDKN2A locus deletion patterns and their prognostic value in adult T-ALL.

**Cdkn2a (Arf) loss drives NF1-associated atypical neurofibroma and malignant transformation.** Rhodes SD, He Y, Smith A, et al. *Human Molecular Genetics*, 2019. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31091306/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31091306/) — also at [https://europepmc.org/article/MED/31091306](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/31091306). DOI: [10.1093/hmg/ddz095](https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddz095). This study establishes ARF as a gatekeeper tumour suppressor that enforces senescence in Schwann cells harbouring NF1 loss, preventing neurofibromas from progressing to malignancy. Conditional co-ablation of Nf1 and Arf in the Schwann cell lineage causes escape from senescence and gives rise to atypical neoplasms that phenocopy human atypical neurofibromas and progress to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs) at high frequency. The findings mechanistically link ARF-mediated senescence to the NF1 tumour suppression axis and explain how CDKN2A loss drives malignant transformation in NF1 patients.
